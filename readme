# The pair interaction model


This repository contains the code used to perform simulations of the pair interaction model. The code is written in Python. To run a simulation, use the ocean class found in the Ocean.py script. An example used to run sumulations and save the data using numpy arrays is found in the Run_Bounded_Simulations.py script. Also, utilities useful for the analysis can be found in the Analysis.py script.
